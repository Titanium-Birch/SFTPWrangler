# VSCode Extension Security Assessment

This document provides a framework for evaluating and managing VSCode extensions and Devcontainer features
from a security perspective, with emphasis on risk/reward balance.

## General Extension Evaluation Template

**Use this template for evaluating any new VSCode extension:**

```
Extension: [extension-id]
Publisher: [publisher-name]
Purpose: [what problem does this solve?]

RISK ASSESSMENT:
□ Publisher Trust: [VERIFIED/ESTABLISHED/INDIVIDUAL/UNKNOWN] 
□ Downloads: [>1M/100K-1M/10K-100K/<10K]
□ Rating: [>4.5/4.0-4.5/3.5-4.0/<3.5] (min 50 reviews)
□ Permissions: [FILE-ONLY/NETWORK/TERMINAL/SECRETS]
□ Open Source: [YES/NO] + security review if critical
□ Last Update: [<3mo/3-6mo/6-12mo/>12mo]

VALUE ASSESSMENT:
□ Business Value: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NONE]
□ Alternative Tools: [NONE/INTERNAL/EXTERNAL] 
□ Usage Frequency: [DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY/RARELY/UNUSED]
□ Productivity Impact: [MAJOR/MODERATE/MINOR/NONE]

DECISION:
Risk Score: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]
Value Score: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] 
Recommendation: [APPROVE/CONDITIONAL/REJECT/REMOVE]
```

## Assessment Criteria

   - Network access: HIGH risk (4 points)
   - Shell/secrets access: CRITICAL risk (5 points)

3. **Community Validation (Weight: 20%)**
   - >1M downloads, >4.0 rating: LOW risk (0 points)
   - 100K-1M downloads, >3.5 rating: MEDIUM risk (2 points)

### Value Assessment (Risk/Reward Balance)

6. **Business Value (Weight: 40%)**
   - **CRITICAL**: Core development functionality, no alternatives
   - **HIGH**: Major productivity boost, difficult to replace
   - **MEDIUM**: Helpful but replaceable features
   - **LOW**: Nice-to-have convenience features
   - **NONE**: Unused or redundant functionality

7. **Usage Frequency (Weight: 30%)**
   - **DAILY**: Used in regular development workflow
   - **WEEKLY**: Used for specific tasks regularly
   - **MONTHLY**: Occasional use for specific projects
   - **RARELY**: Seldom used, limited scenarios
   - **UNUSED**: Not used in current workflow

8. **Alternative Availability (Weight: 20%)**
   - **NONE**: No viable alternatives available
   - **INTERNAL**: Can use built-in VSCode features
   - **EXTERNAL**: External tools can replace functionality

9. **Productivity Impact (Weight: 10%)**
   - **MAJOR**: Significantly speeds up development
   - **MODERATE**: Noticeable time savings
   - **MINOR**: Small convenience improvements
   - **NONE**: No measurable impact

### Decision Matrix

- **APPROVE**: LOW/MEDIUM risk + HIGH/MEDIUM value
- **CONDITIONAL**: MEDIUM/HIGH risk + HIGH value (add monitoring)
- **REJECT**: HIGH risk + LOW/MEDIUM value
- **REMOVE**: Any risk + LOW/NONE value or UNUSED

## Processes

### Extension Approval Process
1. Apply template evaluation for any new extension requests
2. Require business justification for MEDIUM+ risk extensions
3. Mandate security review for individual publisher extensions
4. Enforce removal of unused extensions (>3 months no usage)

### Red Lines (Never Install)
- Extensions requiring shell/terminal execution access
- Extensions from unverified publishers with <10K downloads
- Extensions requesting broad file system or network permissions  
- Extensions that modify VS Code core functionality
- Any extension with HIGH risk + LOW/MEDIUM value combination
