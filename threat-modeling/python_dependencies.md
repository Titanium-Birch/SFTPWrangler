# Python Dependency Security Assessment

This document provides a framework for evaluating and managing Python dependencies from a security perspective, with emphasis on risk/reward balance and supply chain security.

## General Dependency Evaluation Template

**Use this template for evaluating any new Python dependency:**

```
Package: [package-name]
Version: [current-version]
Purpose: [what problem does this solve?]

RISK ASSESSMENT:
□ Maintainer Trust: [VERIFIED_ORG/ESTABLISHED_ORG/INDIVIDUAL/UNKNOWN]
□ Downloads: [>100M/10M-100M/1M-10M/100K-1M/<100K per month]
□ Security History: [CLEAN/MINOR_ISSUES/MAJOR_ISSUES/CRITICAL_VULNS]
□ Dependencies: [MINIMAL/MODERATE/HEAVY/EXCESSIVE] (transitive deps)
□ Code Quality: [EXCELLENT/GOOD/AVERAGE/POOR] (typing, tests, docs)
□ Maintenance: [ACTIVE/MAINTAINED/SPORADIC/ABANDONED]

VALUE ASSESSMENT:
□ Business Value: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/UNNECESSARY]
□ Alternative Options: [NONE/LIMITED/SEVERAL/MANY]
□ Usage Scope: [CORE_FUNCTIONALITY/FEATURE/UTILITY/DEV_ONLY]
□ Replacement Cost: [IMPOSSIBLE/DIFFICULT/MODERATE/EASY]

DECISION:
Risk Score: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]
Value Score: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
Recommendation: [APPROVE/CONDITIONAL/REPLACE/REMOVE]
```

   - **HIGH**: Important features, difficult to replace
   - **MEDIUM**: Useful functionality, replaceable with effort
   - **LOW**: Convenience features, easily replaceable
   - **UNNECESSARY**: Unused or redundant functionality

7. **Usage Scope (Weight: 30%)**
   - **CORE_FUNCTIONALITY**: Essential for application operation
   - **FEATURE**: Implements specific business features
   - **UTILITY**: Supporting/helper functionality
   - **DEV_ONLY**: Development, testing, or build-time only

8. **Alternative Options (Weight: 20%)**
   - **NONE**: No viable alternatives available
   - **LIMITED**: Few alternatives, significant trade-offs
   - **SEVERAL**: Multiple alternatives with pros/cons
   - **MANY**: Many alternatives available

9. **Replacement Cost (Weight: 10%)**
   - **IMPOSSIBLE**: Deeply integrated, replacement infeasible
   - **DIFFICULT**: Significant refactoring required
   - **MODERATE**: Some code changes needed

### Decision Matrix

- **APPROVE**: LOW/MEDIUM risk + HIGH/CRITICAL value
- **CONDITIONAL**: MEDIUM/HIGH risk + HIGH/CRITICAL value (add monitoring/controls)
- **REPLACE**: HIGH risk + MEDIUM/LOW value, alternatives available
- **REMOVE**: Any risk + UNNECESSARY value, or HIGH risk + LOW value

### Dependency Approval Process
1. Apply template evaluation for any new dependency requests
2. Require business justification for MEDIUM+ risk dependencies
3. Mandate security review for individual maintainer packages
4. Enforce principle of least dependencies (avoid dependency bloat)

### Red Lines (Never Add)
- Dependencies with known unpatched critical vulnerabilities
- Packages from unknown/unverified maintainers with <10K downloads
- Dependencies that require network access during import
- Packages with excessive transitive dependencies (>100)
- Dependencies that modify Python import system or core behavior
